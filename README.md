# Roslynator <img align="left" width="48px" height="48px" src="images/roslynator-logo-small.png" />

Roslynator is a set of code analysis tools for C#, powered by [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).

IMPORTANT: Analyzers will be removed from Roslynator IDE extensions in the next major release.
It's recommended to use Roslynator NuGet packages (e.g. [Roslynator.Analyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/roslynator.analyzers)) instead.

## Tools

  - [Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josefpihrt.Roslynator2022)
  - [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josefpihrt-vscode.roslynator)
    - Prerequisite is to use OmniSharp. Otherwise (i.e. C# Dev Kit), use NuGet packages with analyzers, refactorings and code fixes.
  - [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/josefpihrt-vscode/roslynator)

  - [Roslynator.Formatting.Analyzers](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Roslynator.Formatting.Analyzers)
- [Testing framework](#testing-framework) that allows unit testing of analyzers, refactoring and code fixes
- [.NET client libraries](#client-libraries) that extend Roslyn API
- [Command line tool](#command-line-tool)
